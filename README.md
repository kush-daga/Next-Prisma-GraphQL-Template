Ive been working on nextjs for quite some time, and decided to make a template for a fullstack NextJs application, this template includes _Full GraphQL + TypeScript Support_ using _GiraphQL_ as the code first schema builder solution (https://giraphql.com) with _GraphQL CodeGen_ end to end setup for full type safety and uses Prisma as the ORM to talk to _PostgreSQL_ based db. It also has codegen plugins installed which will generate individual types for every file or component in your application (so queries written in the frontend will also have full type support). This is I believe quite scalable and I have set up session based auth using _next-iron-session_ which makes it super easy to manage sessions and also having a shared context between the requests. I hope this will be useful to you guys, and I will be updating it alot, so keep an eye for commits, will add more authentication and also add apollo-client in the frontend along with some demo pages styled with _TailwindCss_.
Do star and fork if you find it helpful.
